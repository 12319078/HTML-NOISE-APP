            Noise pollution is a growing concern in today's urbanized world. It refers to the presence of excessive or
            disruptive noise in the environment that interferes with normal activities, leading to harmful effects on
            human health and the well-being of other living organisms.

        <p>
            Noise pollution is a serious environmental issue that requires immediate attention and
            effective measures to mitigate its impact. As our cities continue to grow and technology advances, it is
            crucial to find sustainable solutions to reduce noise levels and create a healthier and more peaceful
            living environment for everyone.

        <section id="main-content">
            <h2>Industrial Activities</h2>
            <p>Noise generated by industries and factories contributes significantly to noise pollution.</p>
    
            <h2>Traffic Noise</h2>
            <p>Vehicle traffic is a major source of noise pollution, especially in urban areas.</p>
    
            <h2>Construction Sites</h2>
            <p>Construction activities produce loud noises, impacting nearby residential and commercial areas.</p>
    
            <h2>Public Events</h2>
            <p>Large gatherings, concerts, and events can lead to excessive noise levels.</p>
    
            <h2>Aircraft Noise</h2>
            <p>Noise generated by aircraft during takeoff, landing, and in-flight contributes to environmental noise pollution.</p>

        <h1>Impacts of Noise Pollution</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Health Impacts</h2>
        <p>Exposure to high levels of noise pollution can lead to various health issues, including stress, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Environmental Impacts</h2>
        <p>Noise pollution can also have adverse effects on the environment, disrupting ecosystems, interfering with wildlife communication, and impacting the overall balance of natural habitats.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Prevention and Mitigation</h2>
        <p>Efforts to control noise pollution include implementing noise regulations, using noise barriers, and promoting public awareness about responsible noise practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Impact on Wildlife</h2>
        <P>Noise generated by traffic, ships, vehicles, and aircraft can affect the survivability of wildlife species and can reach undisturbed habitats. Although sounds are commonly present in the environment, anthropogenic noises are distinguishable due to differences in frequency and amplitude. Many animals use sounds to communicate with others of their species, whether that is for reproduction purposes, navigation, or to notify others of prey or predators.</P>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Impacts on Developments</h2>
        <p>Boat-noise has been shown to affect the embryonic development and fitness of the sea hare Stylocheilus striatus.[65] Anthropogenic noise can alter conditions in the environment that have a negative effect on invertebrate survival. Although embryos can adapt to normal changes in their environment, evidence suggests they are not well adapted to endure the negative effects of noise pollution.</p>

        <h2>Prevention Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use of Ear Protection:</strong> In noisy environments, use ear protection such as earplugs or earmuffs to reduce exposure to loud sounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Controlled Construction Activities:</strong> Implement restrictions on noisy construction activities during sensitive hours, and use sound barriers to contain noise.</li>
            <li><strong>Green Spaces:</strong> Increase the number of green spaces in urban areas to act as natural sound buffers and promote a quieter environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulation of Traffic Noise:</strong> Implement and enforce speed limits, use of noise barriers, and regular maintenance of roads to reduce traffic-related noise.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Educate the public about the harmful effects of noise pollution and promote responsible behavior to minimize noise levels.</li>
